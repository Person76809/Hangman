# Hangman
Guess the word

This program randomly selects a word from a list and displays it as a series of underscores, representing the letters to be guessed. The player then guesses letters one at a time. If the letter is in the word, it is revealed in its correct position. If the letter is not in the word, the player receives a strike. The game continues until the player guesses the word correctly or receives six strikes (represented by the Hangman drawing).
